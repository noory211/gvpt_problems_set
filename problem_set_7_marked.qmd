## Question 1

*Total points: 10*

::: {.callout-tip}
8/10
:::

I hypothesize that the older someone is, the more they like watching golf. I conduct a survey based on an SRS of adults in America. The independent variable is a four-category measure of age: 21-35, 36-50, 51-65, 66-plus. The dependent variable is a three-category measure of how much they enjoy watching golf: not at all, somewhat, very much.

### Part A

Make a cross-tab, by hand, of the relationship between these two variables based on the following (completely made up) data. Make sure that you present both raw counts and the appropriate percentages to examine the relationship.

We want to see how the independent variable effects the dependent variable. You want to calculate the proportions within levels of enjoyment.

### Part B

Do the data support my hypothesis? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant).

The data suggest the hypothesis is true, but with a caveat that it is not consistent across all age group. The proportion of people who enjoy watching golf "very much" tend to increase with age, going from 8.3% in the 21-35 age group to 50% in the 51-65 age group. But the number drops ato 36.3% in age group 66+. In contrast, the proportion of people who do not enjoy watching golf at all generally decreases with age, dropping from 41.6% in the 21-35 age group to 11.1% in the 36-50 age age group. Again, there seems to be inconsistency in the pattern when when we see those who do not enjoy golf "not at all" increase in the age group of 51-65 and 65+. All in all, while the hypothesis can be supported, the nature of the relationship is not consistent.

### Part C

*Points: 2*

::: {.callout-tip}
2/2
:::

Compute (by hand) the chi-square statistic to test the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables. Be sure to show your work.

(5-3.3)\^2/3.3 + (6-5.1)\^2/5.1 +(1-3.6)\^2/3.6 + (1-2.5)\^2/2.5 + (5-3.8)\^2/3.8 + (3-2.7)\^2/2.7 + (2-2.2)\^2/2.2 + (2-3.4)\^2/3.4 + (4-2.4)\^2/2.4 + (3-3)\^2/3 + (4-4.7)\^2/4.7 + (4-3.3)\^2/3.4

= 6.134332

### Part D

*Points: 2*

::: {.callout-tip}
2/2
:::

Using the chi-square statistic that you computed in question 1(c), can you reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables with 95% confidence? Why, or why not?

Degree of freedom = (r-1) (c-1) = (3-1) (4-1) = 2 \* 3 = 6

Given our Chi-Square Statistic is 6.13, it is less than the critical value of Chi-Square with Df 6 and 95% CI, which is set at 12.59. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis because the Chi-Square is less than the critical value set by the distribution table.

## Question 2

*Points: 10*

::: {.callout-tip}
8/10
:::

I hypothesize that people who identify as more liberal are less likely to see gun control as an important issue than people who identify as more conservative. Using the `nes` dataset from the `poliscidata` package, create a cross-tab examining the effect of someone's self-identification as liberal or conservative, measured using the variable `libcon3` variable, and their indication of how important gun access is to them as an issue, measured using the `gun_importance3` variable.

Do the data support my hypothesis? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant). Report a chi-square statistic (it is fine to have R generate the statistic and p-value). What does the chi-square statistic tell you about whether you can reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables with 95% confidence? Why, or why not?

```{r}
library(poliscidata)
library(modelsummary)
datasummary_crosstab(libcon3 ~ gun_importance3, data = nes)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Again, we want to do this the other way: 

```{r}
datasummary_crosstab(gun_importance3 ~ libcon3, data = nes)
```
:::

The table shows that the proportion of liberals who care about gun control is surprisingly higher than the conservatives (37% vs. 33.9%, respectively). The conservative people who care less about gun control also tend to be higher than liberals (37.4% vs. 31.8%). The most clear attitude on gun control can be observed among the moderates in which most of them regard this issue as less important.

```{r}
chisq.test(nes$libcon3, nes$gun_importance3)
```

Df = (c-1) (r-1) = (3-1) (3-1) = 2 \* 2 = 4

Since the Chi-Square statistic is much higher than the critical value with the degree of freedom 4 (9.49), and the p-value is very-very small than the 95% CI (equivalent to 0.00000004118), we can conclude that the result is statistically significant. This means that we would reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative.
